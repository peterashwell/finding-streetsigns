 - [x] Create training set of points used in matches and corresponding images
 - [ ] Compute initial homographies from points using SVD
 - [ ] Compute STE for all points to all homographies
 - [ ] Do not use spatial smoothing and use levenberg-merquadt for one iteration using gco
 - [ ] If it works, use spatial smoothing and see if there is improvement
 - [ ] Repeat in iterations and great success!
