 - Create training set of points used in matches and corresponding images
 - Compute initial homographies from points using SVD
 - Compute STE for all points to all homographies
 - Do not use spatial smoothing and use levenberg-merquadt for one iteration using gco
 - If it works, use spatial smoothing and see if there is improvement
 - Repeat in iterations and great success!
